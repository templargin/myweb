        <div>Random ideas (not mine) or stories which I heard or read somewhere.</div>

        <hr />
        <div>Did you know that most of the watches that you see in the ads are showing 10:10? It is because the watches are smiling.</div>
        <div>&nbsp;</div>
        <div>Be skeptical about the phrase &ldquo;if it was that easy somebody would have had some it already&rdquo;. Humanity launched the first satellite in 1957, sent the first man to space in 1961 and put a man on the moon in 1967. Guess when humanity put wheels under a suitcase - 1987. There is no need to be a rocket scientist to bring tremendous value.</div>
        <div>&nbsp;</div>
        <div>Both men and women are attracted to red. Why? Thousands of years of evolution and ripe fruit.</div>
        <div>&nbsp;</div>
        <div>People are divided into three categories: there are givers, there are matchers and there are takers. Takers eat better, givers sleep better.</div>
        <div>&nbsp;</div>
        <div>Interesting version of hell: eternally watching the best version of yourself succeeding in life from outside.</div>
        <div>&nbsp;</div>
        <div>There are more than 7 billion people on Earth. Imagine a long narrow corridor and a person coming towards you. How many people are out there that you would be embarrassed/scared to look in the eye of in that corridor? Try to live your life so that the number is zero.</div>
        <div>&nbsp;</div>
        <div>In the modern age of abundance it seems that different is better than better.</div>
        <div>&nbsp;</div>
        <div>There is a huge difference between the right word and almost the right word.</div>
