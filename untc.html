<p>As we can see, this name is well covered on the Internet and it feels like I am just creating digital waste by writing these few sentences. But I promised myself to make a written statement for every position I take and promises need to be kept. Luckily, most of the work had been done already by others and the thesis is very simple.</p>
<p>UNTC has three divisions: E&amp;P, midstream and contract drilling. I treat midstream division as a bonus.</p>
<p>Contract drilling. Company has 14 high spec BOSS rigs and 3 lower spec SCR rigs in operation. Drilling rigs market is getting tighter day by day thus pushing rates higher and higher. Last quarter (Q3 2022) contract drilling segment generated $40 million in revenue and $15 million of income at an average $24,000/day rate for BOSS rigs. I think this past quarter will be the worst of the next four. There is a decent probability for UNTC to have generated $160 million in revenue and $60 million in cash from drilling segment alone by the next Thanksgiving Day. If we apply an undemanding 4x multiple to FCF we get $240 million worth of value. We can also look at this segment from a different angle. New BOSS rig costs about $30 million. If the company was to sell all of their rigs at half price today it would get between $200 and $250 million.</p>
<p>After combining cash with contract drilling segment, we arrive at $380-430 million figure. This leaves us with $170 million valuation for E&amp;P division on a more conservative side. I don&rsquo;t know how much this segment is worth but after having generated $25 million of cash with hedges that are hurting badly in one quarter, it should be worth much more than $170 million.</p>
<p>I think the highest risk at this point is a very poor capital allocation decision i.e., dumb acquisition. Majority of new CEO&rsquo;s compensation was paid in the form of RSUs so far and he is highly incentivized for the share price to go up (even though he&rsquo;s already done well given the SP behavior past year). Continuous share buybacks are very pleasing to see. Let&rsquo;s hope UNTC keeps reducing the share count for as long as they can. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This situation reminds me of Pabrai&rsquo;s IPSCO story a little bit: I&rsquo;ll buy and see what happens in a year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
