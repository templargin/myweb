        <p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Cambria","serif";'><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">April 2016</span></p>
        <p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Cambria","serif";'><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
        <p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Cambria","serif";'><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"><strong><em>To my friend Brian</em></strong></span></p>
        <p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Cambria","serif";'><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"><strong><em>A guide to learning a language</em></strong></span></p>
        <p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Cambria","serif";'><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Cambria","serif";'><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">First of all, congratulations! If you decided to learn a foreign language you are already on the right path. On this path, you will find a lot of fun, energy and diversity. Mastery of a foreign language will help you in enriching yourself both culturally and might as well financially.</span></p>
        <p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Cambria","serif";'><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Cambria","serif";'><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Here is what you need to have in order to succeed:</span></p>
        <ol class="decimal_type" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">End goal aka &ldquo;your why&rdquo;. You have to be very clear about why you want to learn the language. Either to be able to talk to girls, listen to music and movies without having trouble to comprehend, or understand what your co-workers talk about all the time. You literally have to envision yourself in the future and imagine how fluent and impeccable your second language would be. It sounds corny and stupid. But it makes a huge difference. Trust me on this.</span></li>
            <li><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">30 min to an hour at least 3-4 times a week. Learning something completely new will take time and dedication. And what is most important - consistency. Better to dedicate 15 minutes a day throughout the week rather than 3-4 hours on Sundays only.</span></li>
            <li><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Practice, practice, practice. Practice makes perfect. And it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you make a lot of mistakes. Just keep talking if you have someone to talk to and they tolerate you.</span></li>
        </ol>
        <p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Cambria","serif";'><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Cambria","serif";'><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Alright, enough of general fluff. Now it&rsquo;s time to get down to the details.</span></p>
        <p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Cambria","serif";'><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Cambria","serif";'><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Every language is 50% math and 50% vocabulary to support the math. Meaning, all languages have formulas on how to structure a sentence and you need to know a handful set of words to use to build it. There will be 3 main structures: past time, present time and future time. It&rsquo;s not that hard. Just about 500 nouns, adjectives and prepositions, and somewhat around 30-50 verbs. And voile, you will be able to communicate. You might not be able to understand everything; however, this is definitely enough to express your basic thoughts, needs or emotions.</span></p>
        <p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Cambria","serif";'><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Cambria","serif";'><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">A fair moment to highlight here: it&rsquo;s very important to learn grammar. Because it is fundamental, it is a base. There are a lot of advertisements of different kinds, which go like &ldquo;tired of boring grammar? tired of learning all those conjugations? learn just by looking at these funny pictures! bla-bla-bla&rdquo;. This is all bullshit (very my opinion). It might be enough if you just want to communicate on the &ldquo;hola guacamole&rdquo; level. But if you want to deserve somewhat respect and attention from a native speaker, you will have to be able to structure the sentences correctly.</span></p>
        <p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Cambria","serif";'><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Cambria","serif";'><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Any language consists of 4 major areas: speaking, listening, writing, reading. Depending on what your end goal is you should be focusing and delegating your efforts differently. For the majority of people who just want to get by with friends (or co-workers) speaking and listening parts are the main objectives. &nbsp;Next, I will describe a step-by-step plan of how to start learning the language, and corresponding tools you will need to use.</span></p>
        <p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Cambria","serif";'><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Cambria","serif";'><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"><strong>Step 1</strong></span></p>
        <p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Cambria","serif";'><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Allocate half-hour to 1 hour for at least 3 days of the week. Within this hour you should learn one grammar rule, do some exercises to practice that rule, learn some vocabulary, and write down the most important keynotes (having a separate notebook would help to keep track). At the beginning of every lesson, you should briefly revise the material of the previous lesson and then carry on with new.</span></p>
        <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;margin-left:.5in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Cambria","serif";'><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Cambria","serif";'><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">A good start is here:</span></p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"><a href="http://www.bowdoin.edu/~eyepes/newgr/ats/">Link1</a></span></li>
            <li><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qIIes2bi1g&ab_channel=AprenderInglesGratisconRodrigo">Link2</a></span></li>
        </ul>
        <p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Cambria","serif";'><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Cambria","serif";'><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Start right from the very beginning &ndash; alphabet. Pronunciation of every letter, accents, and so on.</span></p>
        <p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Cambria","serif";'><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Cambria","serif";'><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">A couple of other websites:</span></p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"><a href="https://studyspanish.com/grammar">Link1</a></span></li>
            <li><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"><a href="https://www.babbel.com/learn-spanish-online/96189-spanish-grammar">Link2</a></span></li>
        </ul>
        <p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Cambria","serif";'><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Cambria","serif";'><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">But I would suggest the first one along with a YouTube video since they actually start with explaining the alphabet &ndash; and it is the right way to start.</span></p>
        <p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Cambria","serif";'><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Cambria","serif";'><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Also, check <a href="https://radiolingua.com/coffeebreakspanish/">this</a> out. It is a very good resource but it&rsquo;s not free. So just listen to the first lesson for free, and stick to the websites mentioned above.</span></p>
        <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;margin-left:.5in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Cambria","serif";'><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Cambria","serif";'><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">I know it is a quite big Step 1.</span></p>
        <p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Cambria","serif";'><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Cambria","serif";'><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"><strong>Step 2</strong></span></p>
        <p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Cambria","serif";'><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Cambria","serif";'><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Besides the actual lessons 3 times a week, you will have to spend a little time every day doing 2 things: listen to something and learning vocabulary.</span></p>
        <p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Cambria","serif";'><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Cambria","serif";'><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">For vocabulary: download the MosaLingua app. It is 4$ or 5$ but it is well worth it. You will be able to learn basic vocabulary with it pretty quickly just by spending 5-10 minutes every day.</span></p>
        <p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Cambria","serif";'><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Cambria","serif";'><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">For listening: <a href="https://www.lingq.com/">LingQ</a>. This website has tons of information. But what you want to use is their dialogues/stories. For every language they have different dialogues/stories divided by complexity level, starting from beginner level. The dialogue/story is written out so you can actually read it as well. You have to do the following: you read it first, then listen while reading it, then write down all the new words that you don&rsquo;t know (best online vocabulary is <a href="http://www.wordreference.com/">http://www.wordreference.com/</a>), then download it to your phone. Now when you are driving, waiting in the line, or just bored &ndash; you listen to this dialogue/story. You probably won&rsquo;t understand a thing at first but it is very important to get used to the &ldquo;dynamic&rdquo; of the language.</span></p>
        <p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Cambria","serif";'><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Cambria","serif";'><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"><strong>Step 3</strong></span></p>
        <p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Cambria","serif";'><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Be consistent with the first two steps.</span></p>
        <p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Cambria","serif";'><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Cambria","serif";'><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">A couple of tips:</span></p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Try to listen to the language as much as possible &ndash; doesn&rsquo;t matter if you don&rsquo;t understand. Videos, music, radio (while doing something automatic that does not require much thinking). Keep listening. Your brain will start getting used to it. You will really enjoy the very first moment when out of the entire sentence you understand one phrase that you had learned before. It will be a kind of &ldquo;aha!&rdquo; moment.</span></li>
            <li><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Don&rsquo;t be afraid to start building sentences and speak. But always ask for people to correct you and apply these suggestions next time. A lot of people kind of understand when they read and that&rsquo;s all. They cannot speak. Start right away &ndash; especially when you have someone to practice with. Even if you are in a Mexican restaurant or buying from a Hispanic store &ndash; try to put together a phrase or a sentence. They will most probably laugh but will still appreciate the effort. Don&rsquo;t be embarrassed.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Cambria","serif";'><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Cambria","serif";'><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Now, in conclusion, I would like to mention a couple of benefits knowing more than one language. There are tons of benefits but these ones I personally think are the most important:</span></p>
        <p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Cambria","serif";'><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">A better understanding of the world. There is a saying &ldquo;Talk to a man the language he understands and you will reach his head. Talk to a man the language he speaks and you will reach his heart&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s like opening a door to a whole new world, new culture, and a new way of thinking. And you will be very good at analyzing things since you will compare things between two cultures (without even noticing it).</span></li>
            <li><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">A better understanding of your native language. Learning a foreign language straightens your thoughts in your native language. You will start paying attention to grammatical structures and rules you used to use without even noticing them.</span></li>
            <li><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Feeling of accomplishment. It feels good to be among a group of people and fluently/freely talks to them in their language. It feels good to understand music or movies, to get jokes or their memes on the Internet. It does feel good.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Cambria","serif";'><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Cambria","serif";'><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Well, I hope this helps you to set a foundation for a long journey of learning, mastering, and becoming fluent in a second language.</span></p>
        <p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Cambria","serif";'><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Good luck.</span></p>
