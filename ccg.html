        <p><em>Mar 15, 2022</em></p>
      <p>It is difficult to do your own writeup after you&rsquo;ve read a <a href="https://amadeusvalue.substack.com/p/comms-group-ccg-ax?utm_source=url&amp;s=r">good one</a> written by someone else. I&rsquo;ll lay down just a few thoughts of my own about the company.</p>
<p>CCG is a value-added reseller. The main divisions of the company are Teams calling (more than 50% of the revenue), ISP (internet service provider) and generic IT services to SMEs. Leadership is betting a lot on their Teams calling product which has a potential to benefit greatly from the tailwinds which growing UCaaS industry presents.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>CCG is a turnaround story led by Peter McGrath who has a track record of transforming something small into something big. Peter has been a non-executive director of the company since its listing in 2017 and was appointed as CEO and MD in April 2019. Since then, CCG dialed down non-core operations, made four acquisitions, expanded their offering globally and are about to start seeing the benefits of improved internal processes and synergies.</p>
<p>M&amp;A strategy is a difficult one and most of the times it does not work. In this case, betting on CCG is betting on a jockey who had had success in the past. Today&rsquo;s global partnership with Vodafone proves the management is capable of landing deals. Delivering on partnership like this and ongoing internal synergies require capital and time though.&nbsp; Investor sentiment remains negative or neutral at best because of the company&rsquo;s murky past. We can clearly see that the company is going in the right direction and most likely is a good long-term (2-3 years) investment. However, I think it will take at least a year before the sentiment changes and the full benefits of synergies and new acquisitions are reflected on the financial statements.</p>
