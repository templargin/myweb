      <p><em>Feb 13, 2022</em></p>
      <p>I'm making a commitment a to write every week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mostly, I will be writing about small public companies. I intentionally do not call it &ldquo;writing an investment thesis&rdquo; because that would imply investing in the company I write about. What&rsquo;s the purpose then? The purpose is to get into a habit of constantly looking for companies and then being able to analyze them in a rapid fashion. Writing about a company makes you a better investor because it is difficult to lie to yourself on paper. Very often in your head you think you&rsquo;ve covered everything you need to know about the company. But the moment you sit down to put your thoughts in writing you quickly realize that you don&rsquo;t have answers to certain questions. More importantly, you start to come up with some questions you didn&rsquo;t even think of before. I think this last part is the most useful part of writing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why once a week? It is a decent amount of time to make a first dive into the company. If you cannot figure out the landscape in which company operates within a week you shouldn't be looking at it in the first place. I'm not saying that a week is enough to make an investment decision (sometimes it is). But I do think a week is enough to more or less realize what is going on with the company - how they make money, what the main product or service is, and what needs to happen for the share price to grow (well, one or two levels deeper than &ldquo;grow revenues and earnings without dilution&rdquo;). This is possible because companies I&rsquo;ll be looking at are microcaps &ndash; small companies with one or two main products or services that drive majority of the sales.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The writeups must not include external links, graphs or tables. I think the writeups should be as simple as possible. In my experience, if someone cannot explain things in a language of a ten-year-old they either don&rsquo;t know the topic themselves or are trying to trick you into giving them money. Plus, I am a big fan of Mohnish Pabrai and his &ldquo;thou shall not use Excel&rdquo; commandment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this point I have a list of the companies that I think are interesting. It will be nice to learn more about them by writing about them. If at some point, I run out of the companies I will just write about something else until another interesting company enters the list. &ldquo;Something else&rdquo; means documenting useful findings or expressing my thoughts on certain topics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Writing consistently definitely makes you a better investor and a better writer. But there is another reason I am doing this. As it turns out, I love writing. Well, not the writing itself. Writing itself is extremely difficult for me and I don&rsquo;t enjoy the process yet. What I love is the feeling of having written something. That warm sense of satisfaction visits you when you are done writing, re-writing and editing. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t written anything in a long time. Recently I opened the investing guide I wrote a few years ago and it felt so great. It is really difficult to explain the feeling. The closest analogy would be a feeling when your program finally compiles after hours or even days of coding. I guess both coding and writing represent long periods of pain punctuated by occasional feeling of happiness. I think the two live in the same kingdom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Paul Graham suggests one needs to recognize the approach of an ending. I see one now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is my commitment to write every week for a year. That will make 52 essays. Bon voyage!</p>
