        <p>I have come across this piece of advice on the Internet somewhere. This person wrote a letter to his newly born grandson&nbsp;(<a href="https://twitter.com/BluegrassCap?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">@BluegrassCap</a>). I think this small piece of writing deserves a separate tab.</p>

        <p>Some thoughts about life as you enter adulthood:</p>
        <p><b>Time</b> <br /> This is your most important resource, much more important than money. Do everything you can to have as much time available to you as possible. Don&rsquo;t have a long daily commute. Don&rsquo;t live a long way away from things that are important to you, like your family. Doing new things, like learning new language or traveling to a place you have never been slows down our perception of time and elongates our experiences. Abusing drugs speeds up time and robs you of it.</span></p>
        <p><b>Money</b> <br /> The most important thing to know about making money is to find smart people that are trustworthy. Make yourself useful to them and they will reciprocate. Smart, successful people always want to help other smart, successful people, especially if the younger person is honest and hungry. The best type if investment to make is on that creates a lot of ongoing profit AND has a long runway to reinvest those profits in additional profit creating opportunities. Successful reinvestment is the lifeblood of a successful company.</span></p>
        <p><b>Health</b><br />  Health is wealth. Never compromise your health for any reason. Be as kind as possible to your knees. Don&rsquo;t smoke.</span></p>
        <p><b>Education</b><br />  Formal education is only a starting point. It simply teaches you how to teach yourself, at which point the real education begins. Realize that you should never stop learning at the best way to learn is by studying the successes AND failures of other people. We can read the thoughts of the most interesting people in the history of the world for free by checking biographies out from the library. Just put in the effort. Most of life is just showing up and trying harder than others.</span></p>
        <p><b>Passion</b> <br /> Having a clear passion in your life is the surest way to happiness. Most people don&rsquo;t have one, and most of those who do don&rsquo;t own up to it. Find your passion for art, learning, sports, or whatever &ndash; and run with it. Do it the best you can and don&rsquo;t be afraid to identify yourself with that thing. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to fail doing what you love. Make lots of experiments and take a lot of chances and fail early and often. You will get to where you want to be sooner this way. If you can combine your personal passion with a profession, you will become wildly rich.</span></p>
        <p><b>Love</b> <br /> Love other people more than they deserve. Practice empathy. The more love you give the more will come back to you. Dogs will always love you.</span></p>
