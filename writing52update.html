        <p><em>Mar 23, 2022</em></p>
      <p>It is very difficult to make a full blown writeup about a company you are not excited about. Researching and writing about Imexhs or Ensurance was an entertaining process because I liked (and still like) the companies and wanted to know more and more as I kept digging.</p>
<p>I think the right way to do research on a company is to start by looking for reasons not to invest in the company. The moment you see something you don&rsquo;t like it becomes taxing to keep digging and sourcing material for the writeup.</p>
<p>However, it is still useful to think about a particular company at the time, arrive to certain conclusions about the company and write down those conclusions &ndash; what you like and don&rsquo;t like, what you think will happen to the company in the next year or two. The usefulness comes in analyzing your conclusions after some time will have passed. This is the approach I will take from now on &ndash; doing shorter writeups about companies that I am not that excited about.</p>
